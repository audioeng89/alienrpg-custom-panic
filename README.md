2. Paste this [link to the module.json](https://github.com/audioeng89/alienrpg-custom-panic/releases/latest/download/module.json) into the field at the bottom, then hit Install.  
3. The module uses [Lib-wrapper](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper/) to safely protect against module conflicts, so install this if prompted.  
4. Enter your game world, and use the `Manage Modules` menu to enable **AlienRPG Custom Panic**.  
5. Configure your Panic Roll Tables as you like, or pick the preset from the **Custom Panic** Compendium.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Custom Panic Configuration

Custom Panic defaults to the built-in AlienRPG Panic Table and Space Combat Panic Roll tables (which are not included!), or you can specify different tables to use.  
The module includes a heavily nested roll table example in the supplied compendium, [based on this excellent idea](https://forum.frialigan.se/viewtopic.php?t=13311) by Teean.

Configuration settings are found in the **Settings Menu** under **AlienRPG Custom Panic**.  
The module allows you to specify:

- Custom roll table names for both Panic and Space Combat Panic rolls
- Custom dice rolls for each
- The roll threshold at which the Panic status effect is applied
- For regular panic: separate thresholds for Permanent Trauma and Catatonic effects, displaying appropriate text in chat and setting the player to **unconscious**.

Between all these options, you can configure your roll tables however you like for entirely homebrew Panic Rolls, while still benefiting from the automation of the AlienRPG character sheets.

## üîÑ Automated Stat Adjustments

As an optional feature, **AlienRPG Custom Panic** supports integrated stat modifiers by automatically parsing stat keys from your roll table results and applying them to the character.

It works by assigning a **‚Äúpanic item‚Äù** when a roll table result is triggered. This item is named using the stats applied or by the text at the start of your roll table result, if it begins with:

    <b>CONDITION NAME</b>

Panic items are automatically removed when the character‚Äôs panic ends, resetting their stats to normal (with the exception of **HEALTH** / damage and **STRESS**).

### üìå How to encode stat modifiers

You can place the stat change anywhere in your roll table's result text for a natural, readable entry.

Use the format:

- `STAT+NUM` to increase a stat
- `STAT-NUM` to decrease a stat

‚úÖ **Always use ALL-CAPS** for the stat name, immediately followed by the `+` or `-` number, with no spaces.

---

### üìù Available Stat Modifiers

**Attributes:** `HEALTH`, `STRESS`, `STRENGTH`, `AGILITY`, `WITS`, `EMPATHY`  
**Skills:** `CLOSE COMBAT`, `COMMAND`, `COMTECH`, `HEAVY MACHINERY`, `MANIPULATION`, `MEDICAL AID`, `MOBILITY`, `OBSERVATION`, `PILOTING`, `RANGED COMBAT`, `STAMINA`, `SURVIVAL`

| Syntax      | Meaning             |
|-------------|----------------------|
| `STAT+NUM`  | Increase stat by NUM |
| `STAT-NUM`  | Decrease stat by NUM |

---

### üí° Example

    <b>Jump scare:</b> You suffer STRESS+2 and all skill checks are rolled with EMPATHY-2 but you have CLOSE COMBAT+1 until your panic ends.

This makes it easy to write descriptive effects that also encode the data needed to automatically apply and remove stat changes.
